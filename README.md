# IMG-TXT-Generative-Adversarial-Network
I have tried to find relation between image and text and generating them simultaneously using Generative Adversarial Networks.

Following is the architecture of my model

## Please click on the image for a larger view

Programming language used: python 3.5

Libraries used: tensorflow 1.4,
                numpy, matplotlib and pickle
### I trained them using around 12 GB of GPU memory which took approximately 2 days

Below are some snippets of the results of images and text generated during training. Please compare both image and text generated to know the relation between them.

1)For epoch 27

 #### NOTE: epoch number in image and text are different because for text i have startted from epoch 0. So please make sure while taking a look into the results folder img_results folder has all images and generated_txt file has the generated text(*starting from epoch 0)
